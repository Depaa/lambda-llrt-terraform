This module will create a new LAmbda with LLRT runtime.

LLRT: https://github.com/awslabs/llrt

It's just experimental, so for now this is what it does:
ðŸ”¹ It fetches the "latest" "arm64" binary version of LLRT from their github
ðŸ”¹ It builds the lambda function following the package.json in root folder
